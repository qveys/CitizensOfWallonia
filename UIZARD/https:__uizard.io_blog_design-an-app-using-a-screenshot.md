## Upload your screenshot to Uizard

Once you've opened up a new app design project, it's now time to upload a screenshot and transform it into an customizable design. Uploading your screenshot to Uizard is super easy, and there are a couple of ways you can go about doing it.

### Method 1: Use a QR code

To upload a screenshot directly from your phone, once you've clicked the screenshot feature button, all you need to do is scan the QR code with your phone camera. From here, you can simply take a screenshot of an app on your handheld device, click the 'Select from files' option, and grab the screenshot from the image library.

### Method 2: Drag and drop your screenshot into Uizard

Alternatively, you can upload a screenshot directly from your computer. Simply select the file you want to import from your local storage and drag it into Uizard to kick off the upload. Screenshot Scanner works great for all device types, so be sure to check the output resolution on the left-hand side of the upload interface before clicking 'import'.

## Update and customize your screenshot

Once you've clicked 'Upload', this is where the fun begins. Watch as Uizard transforms your screenshot into a customizable design where you can update the images, text, buttons, components, and even the overall layout of the screen.

The possibilities and potential are limitless here. You can add in your own branding and update text and images to align with your vision; essentially, you can take any app, website, or webpage you find out in the wild and adapt it to suit your own project!

## Upload more screenshots and connect your screens

The Screenshot Scanner journey doesn't end with a mockup of a single screen for your app design, use the tool wisely and you can spin out an entire [prototype](https://uizard.io/blog/guide-to-app-prototyping/) in next to no time. Once you're happy with your initial screen, simply scan in the other screenshots you want to incorporate into your project.

The beauty here is you can use screens from your existing app and replicate how it looks with a design tool, you can upload all the core screens of your favorite app, or you can even import various screens from several different apps to create something truly special. Uizard can even support you to update the UI theme of all the screens in your project using Theme Generator! 

Once you're happy with your design, you can now add clickable links to the project to transform your mid-fi mockup into a clickable prototype.
