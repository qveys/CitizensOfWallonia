# Uizard launches world’s first AI-powered design tool for non-designers

Yes, you heard that right, Uizard can turn hand-drawn sketches into digital wireframes, turn screenshots in mockups, and generate UI designs from text prompts, all with the power of AI.

## February 10, 2021 (Launch day)

Help is on the way for non-designers, those sick of being pigeon-holed into cookie-cutter templates, or those locked out of the design process altogether. Today, Uizard is launching a personalized, AI-powered Design Assistant to help those without design or coding knowhow create custom web and mobile apps and prototypes. Uizard’s software can turn any source of inspiration — from hand drawn sketches or wireframes to paintings or jpegs — into custom-themed digital products in seconds.

Uizard is publicly launching its AI-powered [Design Assistant](https://uizard.io/design-assistant/) with a strong roster of companies currently using it, including IBM, Google, Adidas, Hitachi Solutions, Cognizant, Samsung, Experian, and others. A waiting list of over 120,000 people who have signed up to try the solution, along with the general public, can now access both free and paid versions of the software - you can find more information over at Uizard's pricing page.

Uizard’s Design Assistant helps democratize design by enabling anyone to develop beautiful, customized web or mobile products in minutes — all that’s required is inspiration. Users can upload hand-drawn sketches of an app or website and Uizard will turn those into usable digital products — squiggly lines become text blocks, squares or circles with an “X” become images, a rectangle with a squiggle mark becomes a clickable button. To see a video of how this feature works, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTcVXDzjz8A).

To customize the look and feel of these products, Uizard has pioneered the world’s first theme generator technology, which can automatically extract colors, fonts, and styling properties from everyday objects — a poster seen on the metro, an image found online, or a hand-drawn picture — to create a unique theme based on a user’s design inspiration. To see a video of how this feature works, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWE8NPI7G_g&feature=youtu.be).

_“For decades, designers have been spoiled with specialized tools just made for them: Photoshop, Sketch, InVision, Figma, to name just a few,”_ says Tony Beltramelli, Uizard’s CEO. _“It’s time for a tool made for the rest of us so we can have a say in the design process too.”_

Uizard’s ground breaking technology works by leveraging machine learning principles in new and interesting ways. The company has pioneered the training of neural networks to generate text — in the form of symbolic representations and computer code — from user interface images. This enables the Uizard software to scan an image, generate lines of computer code based on what it sees, and use this information to infer the concepts represented in the image — a login form, a button with a text that says "purchase," a website navigation bar. As a result, this technology allows users to easily and quickly turn rough hand-drawn sketches into interactive app screens, or turn screenshots into editable design layouts.

As a design tool for non-designers, potential users span a wide variety of roles and responsibilities across most industries. In beta testing, users ranged from founders, marketing executives, product managers, engineering leads, business analysts, and more. Popular use-cases from beta testing included founders using the product to create their company’s first interactive prototype; teams using it for brainstorming and design sprints; and agency consultants creating prototypes for clients without a designer.

The Uizard team made headlines with the release of a [research paper in 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07962.pdf) that outlined the team’s unique machine learning approach. That research formed the basis for the company’s core technology and has now been cited in more than 100 scientific papers including peer-reviewed articles from researchers in the world's most prestigious institutions such as MIT, University College London, Brown University, University of Edinburgh, The Alan Turing Institute, and others; and industrial research labs such as Google Research, Microsoft Research, Adobe Systems, IBM Research, and others.

Uizard was founded in April 2017 by a group of friends in Denmark. The company is led by CEO Tony Beltramelli, whose prior work has focused on data science and machine learning. Beltramelli was named to [Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in 2019](https://www.forbes.com/under30/list/2019/europe/technology/#5efeafd75f19). Uizard’s product advisors include Kai Haley, Head of UX Methods and Process and Lead of Sprint Master Academy at Google; Benjamin Wilkins, VP of Design at Jumpstart; Julianna Slocum, Staff User Experience Designer at LinkedIn; and others.

_“Today, every company, regardless of industry, is a software company that needs to build user-friendly products to serve customers, employees, or both. Despite this, most employees are not software design experts. Uizard’s mission is to democratize design, and**** enable anyone to easily and quickly materialize, communicate, and test their ideas.” _**Tony Beltramelli**

Uizard has raised $3.6 million in funding from a number of investors, including byFounders, LDV Capital, av8 Ventures, New York Venture Partners, The Nordic Web Ventures, 7Percent Ventures, Tiny VC and angel investors Scott Kurnit, Peter Stern, Julia Qiu, Duncan Grierson, Lars Houbak and Alex Spiro.
