## Develop your skills

In addition to mastering tools and understanding your domain, a holistic approach involves continually developing your skills and building a strong professional network. This multidisciplinary field demands a range of skills such as product strategy, user research, and stakeholder management.

Network is crucial. Set up a LinkedIn profile and follow and interact with other product managers and product leaders. Get vocal and share both personal and industry news. This shows that you are worth networking with; you are professional, hardworking and, more importantly, interested in your industry.

Create your own interview tasks briefs, showcase how you would approach it and share it on LinkedIn. For example, identify problems with digital products and find solutions that you can then present as visual mockups. This is a great conversation starter on LinkedIn and will show others that you can define product problems and identify solutions.

**Top tip:** Use Uizard’s Screenshot Scanner to take screenshots of digital products and iterate them based on how you would showcase changes to improve a user’s experience with that product!

## Cultivate your mindset

Lastly, cultivate a positive and resilient mindset. Embrace the uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity of product development by staying curious, creative, and customer-centric. Be flexible, adaptable, and open to feedback. Cultivating your mindset enables you to overcome obstacles, seize opportunities, and achieve success in this dynamic and challenging field.
