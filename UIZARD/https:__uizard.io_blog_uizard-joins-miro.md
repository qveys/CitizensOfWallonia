# Uizard joins Miro!

Anyone can have a great idea but how many ideas actually see the light of day? How many ideas become a prototype that can be tested? Sadly, way too few of them.

We started Uizard in 2018 with one goal: to make product design accessible to everyone. We want to empower innovators, disruptors, and creators and enable them to turn their wildest ideas into beautiful UIs, wireframes, and prototypes as quickly as possible.

From our very first hacking session in a Mountain View garage, to formally building our MVP in Copenhagen, delivering on that mission has been our #1 priority.

From the beginning we strongly believed that the only way we could democratize the design experience was to build new modalities and technologies that could level the playing field ‚Äî namely AI and machine learning.

Needless to say, having a strong conviction to build a machine learning and AI-powered design tool in 2018 was misunderstood and confusing to a lot of people ‚Äî we were utterly (and stubbornly üòÖ) convinced.

With feedback and guidance from our amazing early adopters, we‚Äôve been able to build a market-leading, collaborative, AI-powered UI design tool that‚Äôs used today by more than 3M professionals worldwide, including teams at Fortune 500 companies.

We truly believe that we have made meaningful progress towards democratizing the design process so that everyone, everywhere can build amazing products. But there‚Äôs still a ton more we need to do to fully realize our mission!

That‚Äôs why, today, we are absolutely thrilled to announce that we are joining the [Miro](https://miro.com/) family! üéâ

We are extremely excited to be joining the Miro team to help cross-functional teams do their best work together, and to continue delivering incredible value to our customers, while also reaching millions more.  

**Why Miro?**

We have long admired Miro and their mission to empower teams to create the next big thing. In fact, many of us here at Uizard [use Miro alongside Uizard](https://uizard.io/blog/how-to-use-miro-with-uizard/) to accelerate ideation, design, and prototyping. We share the same vision and passion for making it easier and faster for teams to innovate and to accelerate their product lifecycle. Not only did Miro pioneer the idea of visual collaboration technology, they continue to push themselves to exceed expectations for what an innovation workspace can and should do. 

**What Comes Next?**

For now, Uizard will continue to be available and nothing related to your day to day product experience will change. We are excited about the possibilities that deeper integrations with Miro‚Äôs platform open, and will be working tirelessly over the next few months to explore how to bring our two products and technologies together.

But wait, there's more! ü§©

We're on the brink of launching a major product update that we believe will elevate your experience to new heights and accelerate ideation, design, and prototyping. Without giving away too much, let's just say it's something we've been working tirelessly on, and we can't wait for you to see it in action.

Spoiler alert: it might have something to do with Autodesigner 2.0‚Ä¶ ü§ê

**Thank you!**

Massive thanks to everyone who‚Äôs been instrumental in enabling us to make Uizard what it is today: our enthusiastic community of early adopters, all the customers that trust us, our amazing team, and all our investors who believed in our AI-driven vision before AI was cool. 

Thank you all! üôåüíõ

We very much look forward to building the future of innovation with the great folks at Miro!
