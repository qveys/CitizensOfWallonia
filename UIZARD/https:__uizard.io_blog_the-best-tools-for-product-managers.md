Whether you’re a [Product Manager](https://uizard.io/solutions/product-managers/) looking for a new tool to incorporate into your workflow, or you’re curious to see if your favorite tool has made it onto our list, then you’re in the right place. 

Tools for product managers can make discovery quicker, iterating faster and collaborating with your product team easier than ever. So what are some tools that can help you with roadmap creation, user insights and feature overviews?

Notion

Slack

Miro

Productboard

Amplitude/Hotjar

Typeform

Calendly & ZOOM

Uizard

In this article we will run through how you as a product manager can use these tools, and how they can work alongside Uizard to complete your workflow, and impress stakeholders.

## Tools for product managers

With tools to help with mundane tasks, planning sessions and more, you can make life that little bit easier and cover every aspect of the product process — whether that is working on features, or solving user issues. From the discovery process and team collaboration to user insights, we’ve put together a list of our favorite tools for product managers, and how they can be used with Uizard to improve a PM’s workflow. 

### Notion

Notion is a popular note-taking application tool that can be used by product managers to create roadmaps, to plan current and upcoming tasks, and for strategy documents. Notion even has specific templates that PMs can use. Product managers can boost productivity and organization with Notion, and ensure that everyone in their team is in line with the correct goals and expectations. 

PMs can use Notion for feature overviews, and then add a direct link to a Uizard prototype for easy access. Notion can also help with task delegation in Uizard as team members can be assigned and tagged in tasks. So when product managers and their teams hop into Uizard, everyone understands their role in the process. 

### Slack

Slack is an online messaging application used by companies to connect and chat with their teams. It’s key that product managers can contact their team members as well as other co-workers, and Slack provides a platform to do so. PMs can not only send messages, but create channels to keep track of individual projects and their progress, in which they can provide relevant, streamlined updates. 

Using Slack with Uizard offers a smooth crossover of product team communication. Product managers can quickly prototype solutions in Uizard, and then share as images in slack to reduce back and forth. Visualizing Uizard ideas in Slack can speed up communication, and the product process for PMs and their teams. Not to mention, PMs can carry on the conversation within the Uizard editor using the comments function.

### Miro

[Miro](https://miro.com/) is an example of a collaborative ideation tool that is great for product managers and their teams. Miro can be used for user journey maps, and for facilitating workshops via the whiteboard feature. Here a variety of templates, as well as add-ons such as sticky notes can help to document internal or external feedback. 

Take your Miro sessions and use them to begin a wireframe Uizard, or to expand an existing prototype. Ideating in Uizard is quick and easy, especially when you have a detailed user journey in a tool such as Miro. As a wireframing tool for product managers, Uizard allows PMs to ideate freely in low-fidelity or take it to the next level as a click-through prototype. Check out our article '[How to use Miro with Uizard](https://uizard.io/blog/how-to-use-miro-with-uizard/)' for more tips and tricks.

### Productboard

Productboard is purpose-built for product management and condenses everything a product manager needs, into one platform. Build roadmaps, prioritize features, and gather feedback in order to align with stakeholders, team members and transform customer experiences. 

Productboard can be used to prioritize the needs of a PM, but in order to make these ideas concrete, this tool can be used alongside Uizard to complete a product team’s workflow. Use user feedback to iterate and improve your features in Uizard, create a click-through prototype, or generate design screen heatmaps to test the effectiveness of your UX ideas.

### Amplitude/Hotjar

Feedback and insights tools can be extremely sought after assets in the world of product management. And they allow PMs and their teams to take a deep dive into user data, behavior and gather feedback. The insights tools for product managers that we recommend are: Amplitude and Hotjar. Both of these tools can help to gather analytical data, as well as user surveys and heatmaps to fuel your UX journey. 

Product managers require insights tools to understand users better, and to improve solutions accordingly. And as Uizard is ideal for making UX improvements, these tools can coincide perfectly. By using the insights and user data from the tools mentioned, product managers can make layout and flow improvements within the Uizard editor. Not to mention, with Uizard you can also download heatmaps at any stage of the discovery process, which other tools may only provide later on. 

![](https://uizard.io/blog/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-16.13.21.png)Hotjar can be used by PMs for a variety of insights purposes!

### Typeform

Typeform is a SaaS company that allows product managers to build forms and online surveys. Learning more about users, what they think works and what could do with a few minor improvements, is one of the ways a product manager can come up with solutions. 

To take your solutions to completion however, you can use Uizard to implement any UX related changes that you need. Whether that is iterating a new feature, improving an old one, or making user journey changes, the Uizard editor is equipped for it all. For instance, product managers can use information gathered via Typeform and test it out quickly, and easily with Screen Generator. 

### Calendly & ZOOM

Calendly can help to schedule meetings, including video calls over ZOOM. Organizing meetings can include a lot of back and forth, but with these two tools you can eliminate the effort, and set up your calls easily. Face to face video calls with your product team, or with stakeholders, can be essential to building bridges and connections. ZOOM and Calendly can also be used by PMs to set up user interviews, of which can provide valuable feature feedback and important insights. 

Connect with your product team, or chat to stakeholders via ZOOM and incorporate Uizard while you do so. You can easily share your screen to show what you’re working on in the Uizard editor, and gather real-time feedback. Or, walk your team through a new user flow that you’re considering — the possibilities are endless. Take online collaboration to the next level.
