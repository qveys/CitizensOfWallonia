At Uizard, our mission is to democratize UI design to empower product teams to build the best software products.

To make Uizard's wireframing, prototyping, and UI design experience even faster and easier, we launched Autodesigner last year in [June 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkPNPoV9iTk&pp=ygUMQXV0b2Rlc2lnbmVy) and Autodesigner 1.5 in [October 2023](https://uizard.io/blog/autodesigner-1-5-generate-screens-themes-images-from-text-prompts/).

Today, almost a year later, more than **3.2 million** users and teams are now trusting Uizard to accelerate their product workflow with AI, and over **80%** of all new UIs created in Uizard are now generated with AI! ü§Ø

Today, we are absolutely thrilled to announce that we are launching Autodesigner 2.0 ‚Äî our most advanced design AI engine yet! üöÄ

**GenAI is about to change design forever.**

## **What can Autodesigner 2.0 do?**

With the brand new release of Autodesigner 2.0, we take the intuitive conversational flow of ChatGPT and merge it with Uizard generative UI capabilities and drag-and-drop editor, to provide you with an intuitive UI design generator. You can turn a couple of ideas into a digital product design concept in a flash! ‚ö°

### **1\. Modify selection with AI**

We're constantly looking for ways to put the "rapid" back in rapid prototyping. With Autodesigner 2.0, we're unveiling a totally new approach to modifying UI components.

Need a button in your header or a couple more items on your list? Simply select a group of components and enter your command, your AI design assistant will do the rest!

Example prompts:

  * Add a CTA in the header that says ‚Äúorder now‚Äù and a back button.
  * Add 3 more sections to the list and change the font to ‚ÄúRoboto‚Äù
  * Create SSO buttons for signing-up with Facebook, Apple, and Google.
  * Translate all the text to french and change the image for a picture of a ‚Äúcat cycling in the streets of Paris‚Äù

### **2\. Generate individual screens and UIs**

Whether you're piecing together a digital banking fintech SaaS or the latest mobile dating app, Autodesigner 2.0 can help compose each screen of your project.

Now, with this new release, the AI listens closer to your instructions, and can deliver on prompts precisely and accurately.

Through the chat flow, you can even specify to Autodesigner 2.0 if you want the AI to follow your prompt precisely or if you prefer to do creative exploration and focus on the big picture.

Example prompts:

  * A login screen for a mobile app with all the typical options for logging with a custom account, social media SSO logins, and a link to reset password, or to sign-up if the user doesn't have an account yet.
  * A screen in banking app where the user can see their bank account balance. There's one button to "send money" to peers and one button to "request money" from peers. There's also a button in the footer to show history of past transactions.

### 3\. Generate multi-screen interactive prototypes

Imagine the power to breathe interactivity into your ideas instantly. Autodesigner 2.0 is not just about creating static UI screens; you can also generate multi-screen, interactive prototypes from simple text prompts. 

With Autodesigner 2.0, the AI will also generate alternative design proposals for screens within the interactive prototype so you pick and chose, drag and drop, and customize everything.

Example prompts:

  * A SaaS web app to manage a fleet of self-driving cars
  * A mobile app to order food in rural America targeting farmers

### 4\. Generate styles and themes

You still get all the innovative power of theme generation from Autodesigner 1.5, but with even more finesse and speed. Want your app to exude the techyness of dark themed aesthetics? Just ask. It‚Äôs like having a stylist for your UI, ready to switch up the vibe with just a line of text, in sync with your project's persona.

Example prompts:

  * Make it look like Airbnb with a polished light theme
  * A modern style with shades of blue with a startup vibe

### 5\. Import screenshots and hand-drawn sketches

With Autodesigner 2.0, both screenshot scanner and wireframe scanner get a massive update!

Converting static screenshot images and raw sketches into high-fidelity, editable design assets has never been this smooth. Our AI engine now provides a clearer translation of your ideas from paper to prototype, bridging the gap between concept and creation with stellar efficiency.

### 6\. Design review

Because Uizard is used by designers and non-designers alike, we are refining what a design review process could look like in the age of AI. 

Now you can pick any screen in your project and ask AI to provide feedback about what works well and what needs improvements. Coupled with the Focus Predictor's heatmap to gauge user attention, this new feature delivers insights for improvement, applauds your successes, and ensures that each element of your design is as good as it can. It's like having an expert collaborator by your side, every step of the way.

Autodesigner 2.0 is here! By bridging the gap between human creativity and AI efficiency, we hope that Uizard can offer an unparalleled platform for product teams to bring their visions to life with speed, precision, and creativity.

Whether you're doing nuanced modifications, visualizing end-to-end user journeys, or seeking design assistance, Autodesigner 2.0 is here to help you go from 0 to 1 and accelerate your workflow!

Keep on creating, keep on innovating, and keep on disrupting! üí´
