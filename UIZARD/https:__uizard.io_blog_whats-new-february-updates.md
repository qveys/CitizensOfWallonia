## Figma to Uizard plugin

You can now import elements from Figma into Uizard with our new plugin! Leverage our AI capabilities whilst utilizing the elements you have created in Figma. For more information on how this works, check out our ‘Figma to Uizard’ article. 

## Sticky notes

Sticky notes are now available as UI components in the Uizard editor. Leave comments, ideas and feedback on a design project in sticky note form. You can even change the fill and font color of a sticky note for aesthetic purposes, or to connect and group certain sticky notes together. However, when applying new themes from the Theme Generator, this will not impact the sticky note component.

**Note:** Sticky notes cannot be exported using Handoff mode.

## Dashboard update: Search for projects

Locate your prototypes quicker and easier than ever before with this new dashboard update. Now, you no longer need to scroll through your projects on the Uizard dashboard, and you can instead use the new search bar. Get stuck into your next project in no-time with this update.

## Follower mode

Improve presenting your Uizard project, or keep tabs on your team when you are collaborating in the editor with the new follower mode. You can now click on another user’s cursor to follow their movement around the editor to further boost the collaboration experience in Uizard. 

## Organization updates

There are a few updates to the organizations in Uizard this month to make collaborating in Uizard even easier than before. Firstly, Pro, Enterprise and Business organizations can now allow users with the same domain as the owner to join their organization while signing up. The second update is that viewers can now request their organization’s owners to grant them creator roles with just one click.

## Image Generator updates

This month, the Uizard team has been hard at work implementing improvements to the Image Generator. So, you will now experience a more powerful model that produces higher-quality images and matches your prompt even better than before.
