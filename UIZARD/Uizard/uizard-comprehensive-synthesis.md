## Design Principles and UX Guidelines

### 10 Essential UX Laws
1. Jakob's Law: Respect established interface conventions
2. Aesthetic-Usability Effect: Visually appealing designs perceived as more functional
3. Fitts's Law: Make primary action elements easily accessible
4. Common Region/Proximity Law: Mentally group nearby elements
5. Uniform Connectivity Law: Similar visual elements suggest similar functions
6. Pr√§gnanz Law: Preference for simplicity
7. Hick's Law: Too many choices complicate decision-making
8. Tesler's Law: Inherent system complexity
9. Postel's Law: Minimize restrictions on user interactions
