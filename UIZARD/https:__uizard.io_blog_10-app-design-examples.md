## 10 amazing app design examples

Good app design examples are not hard to come by, but great app design examples, ones that you can personalize and edit yourself, are harder to find. Luckily, Uizard has just that. With multiple app design templates to pick and choose from, both beginners and experienced app designers can benefit from Uizard’s premade templates.

Up next are 10 app design examples featuring Uizard’s very own editable templates. Within each example there will also be one cool feature mentioned. A feature that is sure to make it even easier to complete the perfect app design. 

### Meditation app design

You will find a pastel color palette, as well as themed UI components and elements, spanning from the first design screen to the tenth. This template contains all of the consistency you’ll need for a user-friendly app. 

However you can of course switch up the colors of elements, such as buttons, manually, or generate a few options to pick from. Get started by selecting the element you want to edit, clicking ‘fill’ and you will see Uizard’s ‘generate’ button. This uses the magic of AI to create endless color palette options! Simply type in your word of inspiration, for instance ‘meditation’, and scroll through your color choices to find one that fits your aesthetic perfectly.
