# Uizard Machine Intelligence Semester

![Uizard Machine Intelligence Semester](/blog/content/images/size/w730/2023/02/Header---Uizard-team-photo.webp)

The **Uizard Machine Intelligence Semester** is a 3-to-6-months internship program designed to give hands-on experience with the applications of artificial intelligence engineering and research to real-world problems.

The program launched in 2018 and is aimed at students currently enrolled in Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degrees. Interns will have the flexibility to pick a problem to tackle and will be paired with Uizard's most relevant engineer or researcher. They will be mentored from start to finish — all in an highly international environment and a top-notch engineering culture that has fun solving hard problems. 

Interns will have the flexibility to pursue a range of different directions in their work. Some projects might involve fundamental machine learning and computer vision research; others could include devising and training new large-scale models to improve Uizard's core technology. Relevant projects can even become [research papers](https://uizard.io/research/), blog posts, or open source repositories as done previously. 

We encourage applications from people who have a strong technical background and are passionate about solving hard problems and developing state-of-the-art machine learning or computer vision methods. We embrace diversity so feel free to apply no matter what. The program is on-site in our HQ in Copenhagen, Denmark, and we will do our best to bring you here if you succeed in the interview process.

_The Uizard Machine Learning Semester is currently closed to applications however, you can find out about other vacancies on our[careers page](https://uizard.io/careers/)._

He is especially interested in [AI design](https://uizard.io/ai-design/) in healthcare and education. In his down time, he enjoys hiking, reading, playing tennis, and learning new languages.

> _“This experience has been nothing short of incredible, and I couldn't be happier to have it. Thanks to the great mentorship and autonomy I've been afforded, I've learned so much that I couldn't have in any academic setting or at a larger company. Besides the work environment itself, Uizard is one big family. Everyone is always on the same team, and Uizard's culture is something that everyone would look for in their dream company.”_

He is interested in deep learning and is ecstatic about machine learning and data science applications to real-world problems. Luke is known for his leadership and team-playing skills.

> _“I had a great time re-experiencing the start-up environment but this time in Denmark. The team was really welcoming and eager to teach me things in the machine learning field, as well as life in general. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to work with Uizard and enjoy the time I spent in Copenhagen.”_
