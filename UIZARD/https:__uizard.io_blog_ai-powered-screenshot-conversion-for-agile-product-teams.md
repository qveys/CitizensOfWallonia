# Accelerate product discovery and delivery: AI-powered screenshot to mockup for product teams

![Accelerate product discovery and delivery: AI-powered screenshot to mockup for product teams](/blog/content/images/size/w730/2024/01/AI-powered-screenshot-conversion-for-agile-product-teams--1-.jpg)

As a [Product Manager](https://uizard.io/solutions/product-managers/), you're constantly bridging the gap between creative ideas and practical implementation. It's not just about having a vision; it's about translating that vision into a tangible, user-friendly designs. This is where Uizard steps in, offering a transformative solution that reshapes the way you approach creation and collaboration.

With Uizard's innovative AI-powered screenshot to mockup feature, agile product teams can now take the reins of the design process without being bogged down by technicalities or waiting for design teams. 

Picture this: **you have a screenshot of an inspiring design or an image of an established design that you want to iterate on quickly and easily**. With just a few clicks, Uizard's [Screenshot Scanner](https://uizard.io/wireframe-scanner/) turns these flat screenshots into dynamic, editable mockups.

Want to know how it's done?

Whether refining an existing design or brainstorming a new concept, Uizard helps you **iterate faster, communicate your vision more clearly, and align stakeholders more effectively**. Here's how Uizard's screenshot scanner works and how it can transform your workflow...

## Screenshot to mockup, with the power of AI

Transforming ideas into reality is a core part of a Product Manager's role, and Uizard's AI-powered screenshot converter is _the_ tool you need to make that process seamless. Whether you're revamping your app's home screen for improved user experience or conceptualizing a brand-new feature using inspiration from elsewhere, Uizard's screenshot scanner has got you covered.

Simply upload an image of an app, website, or UI to Uizard‚Äôs intuitive editor, and begin adapting it for your new or existing project. This feature streamlines the design process like never before, allowing you to focus more on strategic decision making and less on design intricacies.

For an in-depth understanding of this innovative AI feature, we have insights from Uizard‚Äôs AI research engineer, Mariana Oliveira Prazeres, shedding light on the capabilities and benefits of Uizard's screenshot converter for Product Managers and agile product teams.

## How does Uizard's screenshot scanner work?

Images are hard for computers. They are essentially just a bunch of pixels with no inherent structure to them. A human can easily spot a line, a rectangle, or even a brand logo in an image but this is much more difficult for a computer to do.

The field of [computer vision](https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision) (aka teaching computers how to see) has existed for a long time. Initially, though, researchers were just trying to come up with a set of rules; the field really took off around 10 years ago with the use of [deep learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).

With screenshot converter, to turn a screenshot into a UI, we deal with a problem called object recognition, where we want to find a bunch of components in a given screenshot (buttons, input fields, icons etc.). This is the same problem solved by self-driving cars or tracking algorithms that monitor the health of the coral reef.

### How do we find design elements in a screenshot?

[Neural networks](https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414) learn by copying what they see, so they are extremely data-hungry and need a lot of examples. So, to turn screenshots into components, we need a lot of UI design examples. Luckily for us, Uizard has over half a million users, so our system has plenty of mockup examples to work with.

### We need a fancy mathematical model (aka a neural network)

Once we have a lot of data, we need to build a neural network that we can train to detect design elements in screenshots. There are also parameters and tweaks to the model formulation or training that usually needs to be done which can take quite a few days to work well (and even longer to squeeze the best performance out of).

As for ‚Äútweaks‚Äù here, we are referring to standard hyperparameter tuning, augmentations suitable to the structure of UI images, and heuristics to improve outputs drawing from old-fashioned computer vision, by observing the neural network errors, or by training other neural networks (Yes, we train neural networks to help other neural networks be better at their task; it's a complete neural network inception).

### A final touch of magic

The main issue with AI is how it can do things really really well, but the outputs are never flawless. So, we use our human skills (aka our designer-asking capabilities) to simplify a design.

What do we mean by simplification? Well, there are only so many ways to design a set of buttons on a screen while keeping everything consistent. We use clever statistics to tidy things up and ensure that we replicate everything in a screenshot as faithfully as possible while maintaining a sense of design simplicity that's pleasing to the eye and that follows design best practices.

## Challenges with Uizard's screenshot scanner

Screenshots of webpages/apps are quite different from regular images in two ways. Firstly, screenshot images are extremely well-structured and logical ‚Äì there is usually quite a lot of free space, components do not tend to overlap, and there is information being conveyed in location.

![](https://uizard.io/blog/content/images/2023/02/UZ_BLOG_230213_ExpertContent_02.webp)Screenshot components can‚Äôt be all over the place or it becomes senseless

Secondly, it is easy to confuse [UI elements](https://uizard.io/blog/what-are-ui-elements-ui-design-elements-explained/). One reason is that there is a lot of so-called ‚Äúinner class variance‚Äù. In everyday language, that means that, for example, two slider components can look very different from each other. Another reason is ‚Äúclass overlaps‚Äù, for example, an input field designed in a certain way can be very difficult to distinguish from a button or an empty input field that looks like a card.

![](https://uizard.io/blog/content/images/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-23-at-21.30.07.png)Some design components exhibit high variance: switches (left) and sliders (right)

### Achieving perfection

It is unlikely that turning a screenshot into a [UI design](https://uizard.io/templates/) will ever be completely perfect. Turning a screenshot into a customizable design as faithfully as possible is a really hard task. There is no ‚Äúthought process‚Äù in neural networks that we can analyze to understand the decisions made by our AI designer when redesigning your screenshot.

Intuition-guided experimentation followed by careful result tweaking is what enables us to get as close as possible to perfection. As with a human designer, mistakes can sometimes happen, but luckily, you can always modify and tweak anything with Uizard's easy-to-use, drag-and-drop editor.

****The Uizard behind the magic, Mariana Oliveira Prazeres:**** Hey! I‚Äôm Mariana and I have a background in applied mathematics. In 2017, I started working with neural networks for deep learning, aka AI, which led to my first full-time role as an AI engineer with Uizard. During my time at Uizard, I worked as the lead Research Engineer for [Uizard Screenshot](https://uizard.io/screenshot/) (screenshot to mockup), and I also improved Uizard‚Äôs Theme Generator. Outside work, I like learning languages, traveling, and doing 1000-piece puzzles.
