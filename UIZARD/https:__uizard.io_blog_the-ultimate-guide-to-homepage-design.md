![The ultimate guide to homepage design](/blog/content/images/size/w730/2022/08/UZ_BLOG_220809_HomepageDesign.png)

Itâ€™s true what they say, the homepage really is where the heart is. If youâ€™re in the process of bringing your digital product to market, or you're refining your [UX design](https://uizard.io/blog/guide-to-ux-design/) flow, then weâ€™re here to tell you that your **homepage design matters**.

Think about it. **Your homepage is effectively your shop window** , itâ€™s the first thing your potential customers are going to see when they land on your website. Sure, months down the line youâ€™ll likely start to see customers landing on your secondary landing pages, but when you first get going, how you've set up your homepage is going to be crucial to your success.

People really do judge a book by its cover when it comes to websites and mobile applications. Get your UI wrong, make a mess of the branding, or confuse your users with cluttered design elements and you might just find that your bounce rate hits the roof before anyone has even had a chance to read your **mission statement** or find out about the service or products you are offering.

## Why great homepage design really matters

Great homepage design will not only help you to transform your web or app clicks into converting customers, but it will also help you stand out from the crowd in what is becoming an increasingly noisy market for most niches. Sure, you might be building a completely unique product in an emerging niche but, more often than not, you are going to be taking on a market leader when you go live. Creative homepage design can be a great way to stand out from the crowd and truly hammer home what makes you different and demonstrate why you are a market disrupter and not just the latest rip-off.

**The 10-second rule of digital product design**

When it comes to all things digital, whether that be homepage visits or product display page conversions, you should always keep in mind the 10-second rule. Countless web and app usability tests have found that, by and large, most users will abandon a session if they do not find what they are looking for in the first 10 seconds of a visit, whether that be hard transactional activity or a specific piece of informational content they might be searching for for research purposes.

![](https://uizard.io/blog/content/images/2022/08/stanislav-2Yj6MBvJ0sg-unsplash.jpeg)

Bearing this in mind when you are creating [wireframes](https://uizard.io/blog/guide-to-wireframes/) or [prototypes](https://uizard.io/blog/guide-to-app-prototyping/) for your own web or app homepages can be a great way to help you solidify the purpose of your page however, it is often a lot easier to do when the page in question has a clear and obvious customer touch point. Creating a _Contact Us_ page that has clean and simple contact information, for example, is always going to be a lot more straightforward than crafting a great homepage that instantly makes your product or service clear whilst also outlining your mission statement.

## How to design a homepage in 3 steps

So, whatâ€™s the best way to achieve your dream homepage design? And what do you need to include in your project to ensure you create a homepage that will smash your conversion goals and truly stand the test of time? Here is how to design a homepage in 3 easy stepsâ€¦

**Step 1: Keep things simple**

The main thing you need to bear in mind with your app or website homepage design is to keep it simple; this isnâ€™t the kind of space where you want to be reinventing the wheel (remember the 10-second rule). Most homepages only need a handful of elements to drive success. This usually includes the following:

â€¢ A main navigation calling out secondary landing pages  
â€¢ A clear headline and descriptive content block clearly defining your brand or MVP and its benefits  
â€¢ A small amount of supporting content for secondary messaging  
â€¢ Descriptive imagery that supports your primary messaging  
â€¢ Social proof (this could be testimonials or a banner calling out third-party reviews)

**Step 2: Centralize your product or service**

This one might sound obvious, but you need to make sure you center your product or service on the homepage so that itâ€™s the first thing your potential users see. When you initially launch your website or app, itâ€™s likely that word of mouth will be the main driver of visits, but youâ€™ll also generate incidental traffic and, eventually, non-branded traffic through search engines. 

Make it super clear for those that donâ€™t know (and those that do) what exactly it is you do, why you do it, and how you do it better than everyone else. This goes for SaaS homepages, e-commerce homepages, and even blog homepages.

**Step 3: Think about your user journeys**

And, finally, make sure you donâ€™t fall into the trap of thinking your job is done once youâ€™ve perfected your homepage design, there are still plenty of opportunities to really annoy your users and drive them to one of your competitors. Make sure you use clear CTAs and navigational elements to guide your user on to the next step of their journey whether that be making a purchase, signing up to your newsletter, or reading some of your blog content.

## Homepage design best practices (homepage dos and donâ€™ts)

If you're ready to brave the world of homepage design with our easy three steps, then just be aware that there are some common dos and don'ts that you will want to factor in to your design flow...

**Homepage imagery**

**Do** : Use images that explain your product or service or reinforce your messaging  
**Do** : Use images that are formatted appropriately (WebP is the preferred image format for search engines)  
**Do** : Make sure your images are responsive to device type to accommodate both mobile and desktop users

**Donâ€™t** : Use images that have no relevance to your MVP, everything you include on your homepage should support your core mission statement  
**Donâ€™t** : Upload images in outdated formats or formats that will add a huge load burden to your page (weâ€™re looking at you JPEG)

**Homepage typography**

**Do** : Use consistent fonts throughout your homepage. Although it is fine to use multiple fonts, a single font keeps your brand image cleaner  
**Do** : Ensure you make a clear distinction between headings and regular content with headings typically larger and bolder than plain text  
**Do** : Markup your headings with the appropriate tags for search engines (H1s, H2s etc.)

**Donâ€™t** : Use more than one or two colors for text, itâ€™s just jarring  
**Donâ€™t** : Use technical jargon in place of clean and clear language unless it is wholly relevant to your target market

**Homepage CTAs**

**Do** : Have clear navigational links both in the main navigation and across the page itself  
**Do** : Use clear descriptive language in your CTAs that accurately describes the target page (this ensures you are meeting your user expectations)

**Donâ€™t** : Use popups that bamboozle your users as soon as they land on the page (the exception here being a footer popup for cookie consent which is a must-have (for now at least ðŸ‘€))  
**Donâ€™t** : Use misleading text in your CTAs such as a â€˜shop nowâ€™ button that doesnâ€™t lead to a transactional page
