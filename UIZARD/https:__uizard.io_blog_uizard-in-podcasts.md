[**Data Skeptic Podcast**](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/pix2code)[|](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2O1BQAE4p5wAVZPOJ5YflO)[**pix2code**](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/pix2code)

In this episode, Tony Beltramelli of Uizard Technologies joins our host, Kyle Polich, to talk about the ideas behind his latest app that can transform graphic design into functioning code, as well as his previous work on spying with wearables. Tony and his team at Uizard Technologies recently developed pix2code, which leverages deep learning to transform graphic user interface screenshots into lines of code. pix2code takes a clever approach based on Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks that allows the generation of computer code from a single GUI screenshot as input. This new method is an achievement because mapping a structured image to a language description is a very difficult task.
