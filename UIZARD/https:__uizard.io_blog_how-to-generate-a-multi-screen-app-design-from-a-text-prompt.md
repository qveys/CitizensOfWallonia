## Generate an editable, multi-screen design in 5 easy steps with Autodesigner

Ready to join the frontline of design innovation? Leverage the power of generative AI to design multi-screen, interactive prototypes for any concept. Here's how to use Uizard Autodesigner in 5 easy steps.

  1. Sign up to Uizard Pro and create a new project
  2. Describe your idea in plain English and select your key terms
  3. Review your Autodesigner project or generate a new one
  4. Adapt the project using Uizard's drag-and-drop editor
  5. Share your project with your team

## Sign up to Uizard Pro and create a new project

To get started with Autodesigner, first you need to sign up for a Uizard Pro account. Uizard Pro allows you to unleash the full potential of Autodesigner, and also gives you access to Uizard's other AI design features.

[SIGN UP](https://app.uizard.io/auth/sign-up?ref=uizard.io)

Once you've signed up and completed the onboarding tasks, there are a couple of ways to access the Autodesigner feature. First off, you can navigate to the 'create' screen and you'll find the 'Generate with Autodesigner' option in the top right-hand corner of the templates library. Alternatively, you can create a project from scratch and find Autodesigner in the 'Magic' tab of the side navigation.

## Describe your idea in plain English and select your key terms

This is where the fun begins. To use Autodesigner, first, select the device type you want to design for. Uizard supports design across mobile, tablet, and web, so the choice is yours.

Next up: describe your design idea in plain English and describe a design style (or pick out a couple of key terms that match your concept). In the example below, we are creating 'a dating app for frogs' with a 'fun and funky style'.

With Autodesigner, you're only limited by your own creativity but, if you are really stuck for ideas, then you can always use the 'Try example' CTA on the right-hand side of the interface which will give you an example prompt to try out.

## Review your Autodesigner project or generate a new one

Once you click the generate button, in a matter of moments, Autodesigner will generate a full, multi-screen [prototype](https://uizard.io/blog/guide-to-app-prototyping/) based on your initial suggestion. The design will come with all the must-have components, buttons, images, and placeholder text your design needs. Autodesigner will even generate clickable links and interactions between the screens of your mockup. To view these, simply click the preview button in the top right-hand corner of the Uizard interface (clickable links flash in blue in preview mode).

If for any reason you want to try another version of the design, you can simply click the 'Regenerate' button which will spin out another version of your concept based on your initial text prompt.

## Adapt the project using Uizard's drag-and-drop editor

Once you have an Autodesigner output that you're happy with, the journey doesn't end there by any means. At its heart, Uizard is an easy-to-use design tool for crafting stunning app and web prototypes. You can update your generated project with new screens, you can add in brand-new UI components and elements, you can update imagery and text with your own branding, you can even generate an entirely new UI theme using Uizard's Theme Generator (also found in the Uizard 'Magic' menu).
